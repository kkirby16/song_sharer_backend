# Javascript Project - Song Sharer

I built Song Sharer in order to be a Single Page Application that has a Javascript frontend and a Ruby and Rails backend.

I've always been passionate about music and so many genres of it. It is fun to share songs with people you know in person and hear song suggestions of theirs- I've found many of my favorite songs doing so.

However, I've always thought there should be a popular app specifically for sharing songs with others you know. You have well known apps like this for videos, short videos, pictures, and other resources, but not really for sharing of songs. Spotify, iTunes, and Soundcloud are mainly meant for your own listening and it isn't really a thing on there to post favorite songs of yours to others you know.

Hence, I decided to make a song sharing website where you can see all songs that have been posted (Read) along with their urls and the name of the person they were submitted by, you can post songs you like onto the website for others to see (Create), and you can see all of the genres our website has as categories as well as their descriptions (Read). I've also added custom CSS to style my frontend.

## To install and run:

-I have two repos, a backend repo and a frontend repo, that you need to get into to run my site.

-Fork and clone the backend repository at this link: https://github.com/kkirby16/song_sharer_backend

-Once in the program, open the terminal and run bundle install.

-Next, run rake db:migrate and rake db:seed.

-Then, run rails s in the terminal.

-Next, fork and clone the frontend repository at this link: https://github.com/kkirby16/song_sharer_frontend

-Run open index.html in the terminal and you will see the site open in the browser.

## How to use the site:

### Video of how to use my app: https://youtu.be/WlAL8AUhsrk

### Or, instructions below:

-Fear not, the site is simple to use. Once you're on the site you can:

-See songs that are listed on the right side of the screen, as well as seeing their song urls and the name of the person they have been submitted by. Just scroll in the box that contains the songs.

-Post a new song to the site with the form on the left side of the screen. Once song information is filled in and submit and the post button is pressed, your song will be added to the bottom of the posted songs list.

-Click the button to see genres to see the genre categories our site has and their descriptions. You can scroll in this box to see all of the genres and their descriptions. To hide this box click the button in the same place that you clicked to see the genres. Clicking that button will now hide the genres box. To show the genres again click that button which has now changed to be a button to show the genres. You can click this button as much as you want to hide and show genres and their descriptions.
